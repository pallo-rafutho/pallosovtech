        I am Pallo Tshepang Rafutho, 21 years old, and a final year BSc Computing student at the University of South Africa.
        I was born and bred in Kew, a Johannesburg northern suburb.
        My interests are chess, golf, computer games, and travelling.
        I would like to join SovTech for the following reasons:
        The core business of SovTech is in line with my studies and aspirations. 
        I would like to be a top business and gaming software developer.
        Whilst still young with little responsibilities, I am available to learn and develop software, travel the world to deploy the SovTech solutions
